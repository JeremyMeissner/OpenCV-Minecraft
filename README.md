# OpenCV-Minecraft

OpenCV Minecraft is a project that aims to implement the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library on the video game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).

This project comes from a class in my computer science school. I had the constraint to use the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library to manipulate images. I decided to make a program that recognize an object (a tree) in the video game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).
